# Age Calculator Bot ðŸ¤–
A slack bot developed using Go to calculate age with implemented functionality for event handling. With the current year in the program and given the Year of Birth (YOB), the age is determined.

You will be able to create this slack bot only if you are an admin for the workspace. Given that you are an admin for the workspace, navigate to api.slack.com/apps, and create an app from scratch.

Follow these steps within settings:
1. Socket Mode: name token and generate token (xapp represents app token)
2. Event Subscriptios: Enable events, subscribe to bot events â€” app_mention, im_history_changed, message.im, message.channels, message.mpim
3. OAuth & Permissions: Add permissions - chat:write, chat:write.public, channels:read, im:read, im:write, mpim:read, mpim:write; install to workspace
